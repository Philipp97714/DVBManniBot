# DVBManniBot

A [Telegram bot](https://t.me/DVBManniBot) for departure times of the public transport in Dresden (Germany). It uses the
DVB-Web-API.

As the screenshot shows, you can ask for a station and immediately the bot answers with a list of
trains, trams and buses, which depart in the next minutes. If you send your location, the bot will search for
you the next three stations and display the according results.
